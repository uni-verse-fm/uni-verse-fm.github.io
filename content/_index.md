# Uni-verse Wiki

Welcome to Uni-verse's wiki !

**In Uni-verse, everyone is an artist!**

Uni-verse is taking producer-oriented audio platforms to the next level with several features:

- Audio sample based search
- Plagiarism detection
- Collaboration
- Resource sharing for music production
- Privante instantaneous messaging
- An Android app for listening
- **MAYBE ONE DAY** direct daw integration through VST

Uni-verse also aims to be an exmple for learning software architects, which is why it's as documentend as it is.

It is initially a school project and is actively being turned into a PoC and a personnal project. It's not production ready and nor is it simply ready at all.

This webpage is a wiki describing how every component of Uni-verse works.

**You are welcome to have a look around!**
